Visit the script AlignIt.ipynb to calculate the symmetry deviation value between polyhedra with the same number of atoms using a script. The script saves the results in the Result_AlignIt folder.

Visit Handcalculation_example.ipynb for an example of doing the calculation in hand.

Both examples are shown on the artificially made structures; triangle_symmetric.xyz and triangle_disorder.xyz.
